- 👋 Hi, I’m @A1bertoVG
- 👀 I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems and MusicTech. My work often bridges the gap between software development and real-world applications, such as automotive systems and music technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in Back End Development (HTML, CSS, Java) through a course by Meta, and expanding my knowledge in C++ and OpenFrameworks. I’m also fluent in German and continually improving my AI professional prompting abilities.
- 💼 **Recent Projects**:
   - **proTron EVOLUTION Parking Assistant**: Developed a parking assistant using Python and a Raspberry Pi, integrating ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement and implementing Ackerman Calculus for precise parking maneuvers.
   - **Composer V1**: Created a software tool for musicians to analyze melodies and suggest compatible keys and chords using Librosa in Python.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML/DL projects, app development, or music-related technology projects. My dream is to work in a Music Tech company, developing innovative hardware or software solutions for music production.
